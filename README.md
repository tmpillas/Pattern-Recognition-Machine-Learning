# Pattern-Recognition-Machine-Learning
## Project for the winter semester of 2025 for the class of "Pattern Recognition &amp; Machine Learning" in ECE AUTh.

Thema A: Estimation of parameters using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (theoritical and scikit learn implementation).

Thema B: Estimation of parameters using Bayes Estimation (theoritical and scikit learn implementation).

Thema C: Classification using Decision Trees and Random Forests (theoritical and scikit learn implementation). 

Thema D: Creation of a classification algorithm of our choices, and tune hyperparameters to estimate unknown labels.
