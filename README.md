# Pattern-Recognition-Machine-Learning
 Project for the winter semester of 2025 for the class of "Pattern Recognition &amp; Machine Learning" in ECE AUTh.

 Thema A: Estimation of parameters using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (theoritical and sklearn implementation).
 Thema B: Estimation of parameters using Bayes Estimation (theoritical and sklearn implementation).
 Thema C: Classification using Decision Trees and Random Forests (theoritical and sklearn implementation).
 Thema D: Creation of a classification algorithm of our choices, and tune hyperparameters to estimate unknown labels.
